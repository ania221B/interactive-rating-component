## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- **`template` tag**. I learnt how to use the `template` tag, it's `content` property, and `cloneNode` method with `true` parameter to copy content inside the tag for further JS manipulation
- **`replaceChild` method**. I learnt to use `replaceChild` method to replace current HTML content with new one. The syntax is: replaceChild(newChild, oldChild)

### Continued development

- JavaScript in general
- `template` tag
- `replaceChild` method
- forms and form elements

### Useful resources

- [Node.replaceChild()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/replaceChild) - This article helped me to replace current card content with content from template tag.
